  Abstract                 = {The exponential growth of the dimension of the exact wavefunction with the size of a chemical system makes it impossible to compute chemical properties of large chemical systems exactly. A myriad of ab initio methods that use simpler mathematical objects to describe the system has thrived on this realization, among which the variational second order density matrix method. The aim of my thesis has been to evaluate the use of this method for chemistry and to identify the major theoretical and computational challenges that need to be overcome to make it successful for chemical applications. 
The major theoretical challenges originate from the need for the second order density matrix to be N-representable: it must be derivable from an ensemble of N-electron states. Our calculations have pointed out major drawbacks of commonly used necessary N-representability conditions, such as incorrect dissociation into fractionally charged products and size-inconsistency. We have derived subspace energy constraints that fix these problems, albeit in an ad-hoc manner. Additionally, we have found that standard constraints on spin properties cause serious problems, such as false multiplet splitting and size-inconsistency. The subspace constraints relieve these problems as well, though only in the dissociation limit.
The major computational challenges originate from the method{\textquoteright}s formulation as a vast semidefinite optimization problem. We have implemented and compared several algorithms that exploit the specific structure of the problem. Even so, their slow speed remains prohibitive. Both the second order methods and the zeroth order boundary point method that we tried performed quite similar, which suggests that the underlying problem responsible for their slow convergence, ill-conditioning due to the singularity of the optimal matrix, manifests itself in all these algorithms even though it is most explicit in the barrier method. 
Significant progress in these theoretical and computational aspects is needed to make the variational second order density matrix method competitive to comparable wavefunction based methods.},

This proposed method is especially useful to describe systems which exhibit dynamic (weak) correlation at determined geometric arrangements (where the excitation-based procedure is more suitable) but show static (strong) correlation at other arrangements (where the seniority-number technique is preferred). The hybrid method amends the shortcomings of both individual determinant selection procedures, yielding correct shapes of potential energy curves with results closer to those provided by the full configuration interaction method.},

  Abstract                 = {Representability conditions on the one- and two-particle density matrix for fermion systems are formulated by means of Grassmann integrals. A positivity condition for a certain kind of Grassmann integral is established which, in turn, induces the well-known G-, P- and Q-Conditions of quantum chemistry by an appropriate choice of the integrand. Similarly, the T1- and T2-Conditions are derived. Furthermore, quasifree Grassmann states are introduced and it is shown that every so-called generalized one-particle density matrix which is bounded between 0 and 1 corresponds to a unique quasifree Grassmann state.},

Bytautas, T. M. Henderson, C. A. Jimenez-Hoyos, J. K. Ellis, and G. E. Scuseria, J. Chem. Phys.135, 044119 (2011)]. A numerical analysis is performed for the C2 and LiF molecules, for the CH2 singlet diradical as well as for the symmetric stretching of hypothetical (linear) hydrogen chains. For these test cases, the proposed orbital-optimization protocol yields similar results to its variational orbital optimization counterpart, but prevents symmetry-breaking of molecular orbitals in most cases.},

  Abstract                 = {While restricted single-reference coupled cluster theory truncated to singles and doubles (CCSD) provides very accurate results for weakly correlated systems, it usually fails in the presence of static or strong correlation. This failure is generally attributed to the qualitative breakdown of the reference, and can accordingly be corrected by using a multi-determinant reference, including higher-body cluster operators in the ansatz, or allowing symmetry breaking in the reference. None of these solutions are ideal; multi-reference coupled cluster is not black box, including higher-body cluster operators is computationally demanding, and allowing symmetry breaking leads to the loss of good quantum numbers. It has long been recognized that quasidegeneracies can instead be treated by modifying the coupled cluster ansatz. The recently introduced pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) approach is one such example which avoids catastrophic failures and accurately models strong correlations in a symmetry-adapted framework. Here we generalize pCCD to a singlet-paired coupled cluster model (CCD0) intermediate between coupled cluster doubles and pCCD, yielding a method that possesses the invariances of the former and much of the stability of the latter. Moreover, CCD0 retains the full structure of coupled cluster theory, including a fermionic wave function, antisymmetric cluster amplitudes, and well-defined response equations and density matrices.},

  Abstract                 = {Properties of the sum of the q algebraically largest eigenvalues of any real symmetric matrix as a function of the diagonal entries of the matrix are derived. Such a sum is convex but not necessarily everywhere differentiable. A convergent procedure is presented for determining a minimizing point of any such sum subject to the condition that the trace of the matrix is held constant. An implementation of this procedure is described and numerical results are included. Minimization problems of this kind arose in graph partitioning studies [8]. Use of existing procedures for minimizing required either a strategy for selecting, at each stage, a direction of search from the subdifferential and an appropriate step along the direction chosen [10,13] or computationally feasible characterizations of certain enlargements of subdifferentials [1,6] neither of which could be easily determined for the given problem. The arguments use results from eigenelement analysis and from optimization theory.},

Beginning with the quantization of angular momentum, spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum, the author goes on to discuss the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a two-component system. After developing the necessary mathematics, specifically spherical tensors and tensor operators, the author then investigates the 3-j, 6-j, and 9-j symbols. Throughout, the author provides practical applications to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. These include partial-wave expansions, the emission and absorption of particles, the proton and electron quadrupole moment, matrix element calculation in practice, and the properties of the symmetrical top molecule.},

  Abstract                 = {Preface
In volume 1 the fundamental role of symmetry was developed and applied to a wide range of problems in classical and quantum physics. In this volume we move on to some more difficult applications and to a more general study of the symmetric and unitary groups, particular cases of which were met in volume 1. These topics would probably only arise at postgraduate level, but would none the less be of interest to the more inquisitive undergraduate.

  Abstract                 = {The minimum basis set hydrogen rectangular system (HRS), consisting of four hydrogen atoms arranged in a rectangle, is examined using a variety of partitionings of the Hamiltonian H for high order single and double reference perturbation computations. The potential energy surface is mapped out over a range of geometries in which the length L of one side of the rectangle is varied. Several criteria are derived governing the necessary conditions for perturbative convergence of two‐state systems, and these criteria are useful in explaining the behavior of the HRS for the range of geometries and partitioning methods investigated. The divergence caused by intruder states, observed by Zarrabian and Paldus [Int. J Quantum Chem. 38, 761 (1990)] for the nondegenerate, double reference space perturbation expansions at L=3.0 a.u. with traditional partitioning methods, is shown to correspond to avoided crossings with negative real values of the perturbation parameter—backdoor intruder states. These intruder state induced divergences result from too small zeroth order energy differences between the high lying reference space state and an orthogonal space intruder state whose identity depends on the partitioning method. Forcing the valence orbitals to be degenerate enlarges these zeroth order energy differences and, thus, yields a convergent perturbative expansion for L=3.0 a.u. The convergent or divergent behavior of all the partitioning method computations and the locations of their avoided crossings are accurately predicted by using two‐state models composed of the high lying reference space state and the intruder state. A partitioning method is introduced in which the zeroth order state energies are selected to optimize the convergence in low orders of the perturbation expansion. This optimization method yields perturbative convergence which is both rapid and free of intruder state for geometries between L=2.0 and 3.0 a.u. The divergent behavior for various partitioning methods at L=5.0 a.u., also observed by Zarrabian and Paldus, is caused by one or more orthogonal space states and the high lying reference space state that are strongly coupled and have close expectation values of H. The two‐state model illustrates why no partitioning choice with a double reference space can yield a satisfactory rate of perturbative convergence for L=5.0. Therefore, the entire potential energy surface is treated using more than one reference space: a double reference space for L≤3.0 a.u. and a single reference space for L≳3.0 a.u. The entire potential surface of interest, which is generated with the optimized partitioning method and the two different reference spaces, is very accurate by third order, with eigenvalues for all geometries considered differing from the FCI by no more than 1 kcal/mol.},

  Abstract                 = {The wave function for the electrons is investigated when a set of narrow bands (valence states) has its energies within a wide band (conduction states). The valence states are linear combinations of localized states which are attached to each lattice site. The intra-atomic Coulomb and exchange integrals for the localized states are much larger than the bandwidths of the valence states. Some of the narrow bands are neither completely empty nor completely filled. The wave function is therefore expected to be correlated, because it is disadvantageous for the electrons to crowd into the same lattice site, or take up some configuration contrary to Hund's rule. This correlation is important in trasition metals, where it is considered to be the cause of ferromagnetism. The correlated wave function is obtained by applying to the uncorrelated antisymmetrized product of Bloch functions an operator which provides each configuration of localized valence states with an appropriate amplitude and phase factor. The procedure is worked out in detail for the case of few particles (electrons or holes) in the narrow bands with the help of a diagram analysis. The localized orbits of different lattice sites do not have to be orthogonal to on another, and the computational rules are actually simplified thereby. The example of a twofold degenerate band such as the upper part of the 3d band in Ni is treated, and the conditions for the occurrence of ferromagnetism are stated in the case of few 3d holes per lattice site.},

  Abstract                 = {The accurate and efficient description of strongly correlated systems remains an important challenge for computational methods. Doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), in which all electrons are paired and no correlations which break these pairs are permitted, can in many cases provide an accurate account of strong correlations, albeit at combinatorial computational cost. Recently, there has been significant interest in a method we refer to as pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD), a variant of coupled cluster doubles in which the electrons are paired. This is simply because pCCD provides energies nearly identical to those of DOCI, but at mean-field computational cost (disregarding the cost of the two-electron integral transformation). Here, we introduce the more complete pair extended coupled cluster doubles (pECCD) approach which, like pCCD, has mean-field cost and reproduces DOCI energetically. We show that unlike pCCD, pECCD also reproduces the DOCI wave function with high accuracy. Moreoever, pECCD yields sensible albeit inexact results even for attractive interactions where pCCD breaks down.},

  Abstract                 = {A further step is made in the development of the orbital theory of molecular structure, the object being to allow for the tendency of two electrons in the same space orbital to keep apart because of the repulsive field between them. The description of a molecule is generalized in such a way as to bracket together electrons in pairs, the simple theory of molecular orbitals being used as a starting point for a wider treatment. If two orbitals are used for each electron pair (paired electron orbitals), it is shown that the theory contains as special cases both previous results of the present series of papers and also the valence-bond wave function which is shown to be an alternative particular approximation to the general function.},

In 1995 it was mentioned by the National Research Council of the USA as one of ten most prominent research challenges in quantum chemistry. In spite of this recognition the progress was very slow, until a couple of years ago the problem came into focus again, now in the framework of quantum information theory. In the paper I give a survey of the recent development.},

The set of equations considered is obtained when applying the CC method, including two-body amplitudes (CCD), to the H4 model. The complete sets of solutions for the spinorbital and spin-symmetry adapted variants of the CCD equations consist of 20 and 12 solutions, respectively. At least 5 solutions are physically meaningful. In addition to standard and nonstandard solutions of the desired symmetry, broken-symmetry solutions are also documented. A preliminary analysis of the significance of the latter solutions is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The energy of a many-electron quantum system can be approximated by a constrained optimization of the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) that is solvable in polynomial time by semidefinite programming (SDP). Here we develop a SDP method for computing strongly correlated 2-RDMs that is 10–20 times faster than previous methods [D. A. Mazziotti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 213001 (2004)]. We illustrate with (i) the dissociation of N2 and (ii) the metal-to-insulator transition of H50. For H50 the SDP problem has 9.4×106 variables. This advance also expands the feasibility of large-scale applications in quantum information, control, statistics, and economics.},

  Abstract                 = {The random phase approximation (RPA) to the correlation energy is extended to fractional occupations and its performance examined for exact conditions on fractional charges and fractional spins. RPA satisfies the constancy condition for fractional spins that leads to correct bond dissociation and no static correlation error for H$_2$ but massively fails for fractional charges, with an enormous delocalization error even for a one-electron system such as H$_2^+$. Other methods such as range-separated RPA can reduce this delocalization error but only at the cost of increasing the static correlation error. None of the RPA methods seem to have the discontinuous nature required to satisfy both exact conditions and the full unified condition, emphasizing the need to go further than just smooth functionals of the orbitals.},

  Abstract                 = {The recently developed explicit formalism of orthogonally-spin-adapted, Hilbert-space (or state-universal), multireference (MR), coupled-cluster (CC) theory, exploiting the model space spanned by two closed-shell-type reference configurations, is applied to a simple four-electron model system consisting of two interacting hydrogen molecules. Four planar minimum-basis-set H4 models are examined, each characterized by a single parameter that fully determines its geometry, assuming the trapezoidal (H4 model), rectangular (P4 model), linear (D4 model), and square (S4 model) nuclear configuration. Varying this geometry-determining parameter, in each case we obtain different cross sections of the H4 potential-energy hypersurface, involving the dissociation of one, two, or all four H-H ‘‘bonds.’’ Comparing the resulting CC energies with exact values that are easily obtained for this model using the full configuration-interaction method, we can assess the performance of various MRCC Hilbert-space approaches at both the linear and nonlinear levels of approximation, while a continuous transition is being made between the degenerate and nondegenerate regimes. This enables us to elucidate the sources and the type of singular behavior in both linear and nonlinear versions of MRCC theory, to examine the role played by various intruder states, the existence and types of multiple solutions and their ability to describe various excited states, and, by performing a cluster analysis of the exact solutions, to assess the quality of the MRCC wave functions as well as the energies.},

  Abstract                 = {A quadratically convergent valence bond self-consistent field method is described where the simultaneous optimisation of orbitals and the coefficients of the configurations (VB structures) is based on a Newton-Raphson scheme. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in actual calculations. The convergence and efficiency are compared with the Super-CI method. A necessary condition to achieve convergence in the Newton-Raphson method is that the Hessian is positive definite. When this is not the case, a combination of the Super-CI and Newton-Raphson methods is shown to be an optimal choice instead of shifting the eigenvalues of the Hessian to make it positive definite. In the combined method, the first few iterations are performed with the Super-CI method and then the Newton-Raphson scheme is switched on based on an internal indicator. This approach is found computationally a more economical choice than using either the Newton-Raphson or Super-CI method alone to perform a full optimisation of the nonorthogonal orbitals.},

  Abstract                 = {These two volumes deal with the quantum theory of the electronic structure of molecules. Implicit in the term ab initio is the notion that approximate solutions of Schrödinger's equation are sought "from the beginning," i. e. , without recourse to experimental data. From a more pragmatic viewpoint, the distin­ guishing feature of ab initio theory is usually the fact that no approximations are involved in the evaluation of the required molecular integrals. Consistent with current activity in the field, the first of these two volumes contains chapters dealing with methods per se, while the second concerns the application of these methods to problems of chemical interest. In asense, the motivation for these volumes has been the spectacular recent success of ab initio theory in resolving important chemical questions. However, these applications have only become possible through the less visible but equally important efforts of those develop­ ing new theoretical and computational methods and models.

  Abstract                 = {The question of whether given density operators for subsystems of a multipartite quantum system are compatible to one common total density operator is known as the quantum marginal problem. We briefly review the solution of a subclass of such problems found just recently. In particular, this provides the solution of the \$1\$-body \$N\$-representability problem. Its solution, the so-called generalized Pauli constraints, restrict the set of mathematically possible fermionic occupation numbers significantly, and strengthens Pauli's exclusion principle. Moreover, we review the study of a concrete physical model of interacting fermions confined to a harmonic trap. There, we found occupation numbers close, but not exactly on the boundary of the allowed region. This new effect of quasipinning is physically relevant since it corresponds to a simplified structure of the corresponding \$N\$-fermion quantum state.},

  Abstract                 = {A density matrix formulation is presented of the super-C I and Newton-Raphson methods in complete active space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. The CASSCF method is a special form of the MC-SCF method, where the C I wave function is assumed to be complete in a subset of the orbital space (the active space), leaving the remaining orbitals doubly occupied in all configurations. Explicit formulas are given for all matrix elements in the super-C I method and the first and second derivatives in the Newton-Raphson formulation. The similarities between the two methods are pointed out and the differences in the detailed formulations are discussed. Especially interesting is the fact, that while the second derivatives can be expressed in terms of first and second order density matrices, the matrix elements between the super-C I states involve also the third order density matrix in some cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations accurately describes weak electron correlation but is known to fail in cases of strong static correlation. Fascinatingly, however, pair coupled cluster doubles (p-CCD), a simplified version of the theory limited to pair excitations that preserve the seniority of the reference determinant (i.e., the number of unpaired electrons), has mean field computational cost and is an excellent approximation to the full configuration interaction (FCI) of the paired space provided that the orbital basis defining the pairing scheme is adequately optimized. In previous work, we have shown that optimization of the pairing scheme in the seniority zero FCI leads to a very accurate description of static correlation. The same conclusion extends to p-CCD if the orbitals are optimized to make the p-CCD energy stationary. We here demonstrate these results with numerous examples. We also explore the contributions of different seniority sectors to the coupled cluster doubles (CCD) correlation energy using different orbital bases. We consider both Hartree-Fock and Brueckner orbitals, and the role of orbital localization. We show how one can pair the orbitals so that the role of the Brueckner orbitals at the CCD level is retained at the p-CCD level. Moreover, we explore ways of extending CCD to accurately describe strongly correlated systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this graduate-level textbook is to present and explain, at other than a superficial level, modem ab initio approaches to the calculation of the electronic structure and properties of molecules. The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

  Abstract                 = {All atomic particles have a particular "spin," analogous to the earth's rotation on its axis. The quantum mechanical reality underlying spin is complex and still poorly understood. Sin-itiro Tomonaga's The Story of Spin remains the most complete and accessible treatment of spin, and is now available in English translation. Tomonaga tells the tale of the pioneers of physics and their difficult journey toward an understanding of the nature of spin and its relationship to statistics. His clear unfolding of the tale of spin is invaluable to students of physics, chemistry, and astronomy, and his description of the historical development of spin will interest historians and philosophers of science."This piece of the history of physics will provide excellent and exciting reading. . . . It also provides the personal touch of an expert in the field that is so often lacking in the physics literature. I recommend it very highly."—Fritz Rohrlich, Physics TodaySin-itiro Tomonaga was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first application of the Rayleigh–Ritz variational procedure to the coupled cluster doubles trial function. The variational approach is applied to the potential surface of H 4 , the double dissociation of water and the dissociation of N 2 , and the results are compared to standard coupled cluster doubles calculations. It is found that the variational approach gives a greatly improved description of strongly correlated systems, where the standard approach is known to fail. Some examination of the basis set dependence of the results is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been recognized for some time that the spontaneous emission by atoms is not necessarily a fixed and immutable property of the coupling between matter and space, but that it can be controlled by modification of the properties of the radiation field. This is equally true in the solid state, where spontaneous emission plays a fundamental role in limiting the performance of semiconductor lasers, heterojunction bipolar transistors, and solar cells. If a three-dimensionally periodic dielectric structure has an electromagnetic band gap which overlaps the electronic band edge, then spontaneous emission can be rigorously forbidden.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have seen the proliferation of new computer designs that employ parallel processing in one form or another in order to achieve maximum performance. Although the idea of improving the performance of computing machines by carrying out parts of the computation concurrently is not new (indeed, the concept was known to Babbage ), such machines have, until fairly recently, been confined to a few specialist research laboratories. Nowadays, parallel computers are commercially available and they are finding a wide range of applications in chemical calculations. The purpose of this volume is to review the impact that the advent of concurrent computation is already having, and is likely to have in the future, on chemical calculations. Although the potential of concurrent computation is still far from its full realization, it is already clear that it may turn out to be second in importance only to the introduction of the electronic digital computer itself.},
