The world at the level of the atom is described by the branch of science called quantum mechanics. 
The world of quantum mechanics is very different from our own macroscopic world. It is governed by probabilities and there is a duality
between particles and waves.
Its foundations were built in the first half of the twentieth century by a large group of physicists.
The crown jewel is given by the Schr√∂dinger equation which describes a system of indistinguishable particles, that interact with each other.
However, an equation alone is not enough: the solution is what interests us. This is a problem, because only for the smallest system is the
analytical solution known. For other systems we must resort to numerical techniques. And even then we are plagued by an exponential scaling
of the Hilbert space.
